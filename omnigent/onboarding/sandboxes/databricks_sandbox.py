Databricks Sandbox launcher.

Implements :class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher`
for `Databricks Sandbox
<https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/serverless/sandbox>`_ —
SSH-accessible, microVM-isolated personal development environments.

Unlike every other provider in this package, the transport is not a
Python SDK: it is the **public** ``databricks sandbox`` CLI surface
(``create`` / ``delete`` / ``list`` / ``start`` / ``stop`` / ``status`` /
``ssh`` / ``config``), which went GA when the Databricks CLI renamed
``databricks lakebox`` to ``databricks sandbox``
(https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/5487). There is therefore no
optional Python extra to install and no internal dependency — an
operator who can run ``databricks sandbox ssh`` by hand can run this
provider. Commands are built as argv lists and executed WITHOUT a shell
locally, so a sandbox id or path never reaches a local shell.

Platform notes that shape this launcher:

- **Real SSH means real port forwarding.** ``databricks sandbox ssh <id>
  -- -L <port>:localhost:<port>`` passes flags straight through to
  ``ssh``, so this is the one exec-model provider in the tree with
  :attr:`supports_local_port_forward` ``True``. Modal, Daytona, and Islo
  all lack a local→sandbox path and must skip the in-sandbox App OAuth
  flow; this provider does not.
- **But the transport allocates no remote PTY.** ``-- -tt <cmd>`` was
  verified against CLI v1.11.0 to still run the remote command with
  ``tty`` reporting "not a tty". :meth:`stream_exec` therefore ignores
  its ``pty`` argument, and :meth:`exec_foreground` runs without a
  controlling terminal. CLIs that suppress output when not attached to a
  terminal — including the ``databricks auth login`` step of the
  in-sandbox App OAuth flow — may degrade. See the module's open
  questions in the accompanying issue.
- **Stop/start with persistent storage.** Sandboxes auto-stop on idle and
  restart with their disk intact, so a dormant managed host is resumed in
  place under the SAME sandbox id (:attr:`can_resume` ``True``) rather
  than reprovisioned. That matters more here than elsewhere: Databricks
  Sandbox enforces a per-user cap on sandbox count, so a
  provision-per-session deployment would eventually hit the ceiling.
- **No image selection and no create-time env injection.** The CLI's
  ``create`` takes only ``--name``; the sandbox image is Databricks'
  own (Ubuntu 24.04, user ``sandbox-agent``) and already ships git,
  tmux, python3, uv, node, and the coding-harness CLIs, so the generic
  :meth:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.ExecModelHostLauncher.start_host`
  bootstrap works unmodified. There is deliberately no ``env``
  passthrough knob: with no create-time env API, the only way to inject
  credentials would be to prefix them onto the remote argv of every
  exec, which exposes them in the sandbox's process table.
- **PEP 668 image.** The sandbox's Python is externally managed
  (``/usr/lib/python3.12/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED``) and its site-packages are
  not writable by ``sandbox-agent``, so :meth:`wheel_install_command`
  passes ``--break-system-packages`` and lets pip fall back to a user
  install, which precedes ``dist-packages`` on ``sys.path``.

        live against CLI v1.11.0:

        - **Both endpoints are pinned to ``127.0.0.1``**, never
          ``localhost``. Unpinned, ``ssh`` binds the local port on BOTH
          ``::1`` and ``127.0.0.1``, and the sandbox side resolves
          ``localhost`` to whichever family it prefers — so a callback

        - **Readiness comes from ``ssh -v`` itself**, not from probing the
          port. See :meth:`_await_forward`.

        Only bare flags are passed: the Databricks CLI re-quotes what it
        forwards to ``ssh`` and mangles ``-o Key=Value`` (see
        :data:`_FORWARD_FAILURE_MARKERS`), so the equivalent of
        ``ExitOnForwardFailure`` is done by watching ``ssh``'s own

        Remote command that installs locally-built wheels over the
        sandbox's preinstalled omnigent.

        Diverges from
        :func:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.host_image_wheel_install_command`
        because the Databricks Sandbox image is not the Omnigent host
        image: its interpreter is PEP 668 externally-managed and its
        ``dist-packages`` are root-owned, so ``pip`` needs
        ``--break-system-packages`` and falls back to a user install.
        User site precedes ``dist-packages`` on ``sys.path``, so the
        overlay wins at import time.

        ``--force-reinstall`` is required for the same reason as the host
        image: the baked omnigent shares a version with the local build,
        so pip would otherwise consider it satisfied and silently skip.
        ``--no-deps`` keeps the overlay to the local wheels alone.

        :param remote_tgz_path: Sandbox path of the shipped tarball, e.g.
            ``"/tmp/oa-wheels.tgz"``.
