"""E2E: composer model/effort text must stay clear of the Stop button.

On a phone-sized viewport (iOS web), the composer's read-only
``<Model> <Effort>`` label — e.g. ``databricks-claude-fable-5 xHigh`` on a
Databricks-backed claude-native session — extends beneath the Stop
(Interrupt) button while a turn is running, so the composer controls are
unreadable: the model text runs under the destructive square button instead
of truncating beside it.

User journey covered (the reporter's, on iOS web):

1. open a session bound to a long Databricks model id at xhigh effort on a
   phone-sized viewport,
2. send a message — the agent starts working, so the composer's Send button
   becomes the destructive Stop (Interrupt) square,
3. the model/effort text in the composer action row extends beneath the
   Stop button instead of truncating.

Harness notes:

- The session is the standard ``seeded_session`` (a real server-backed
  ``hello_world`` session); the browser's ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}`` snapshot
  is patched into a claude-native session on a Databricks workspace model at
  ``xhigh`` effort — the exact shape the reporter's session has — the same
  route-patch approach as ``chat/test_claude_model_picker.py``. The catalog
  rows carry a ``databricks`` ``source``, exactly as on a real Databricks
  workspace session.
- The turn is held open with the mock LLM's ``block`` gate (released in the
  ``finally``), so the Stop button is genuinely showing while the geometry
  is measured — the same running-turn state the reporter saw.
- The viewport matches Playwright's "iPhone 13" profile (390x664), so a
  recorder run with ``--device "iPhone 13"`` films pixel-exact.
